1. Find maximum no. of intervals to select with no overlap. (Jump Scheduling - I)
--> Jump Problem (DP but like Kedans)


2. Find minimum no. of intervals to select with minimum overlap. (Jump -II)
--> DP solution (Job Scheduling problem)


3. Find maximum no. of intervals which overlap at a point? (Maximum no. of train platforms problem)
--> Use a counter variable and add 1 when an interval starts and subtract 1 when an interval ends.
    max of counter is ans.
